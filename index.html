            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a DPhil student in the Biology Department, funded by the <a href="https://ecowild.site.hw.ac.uk/">EcoWild NERC Centre for Doctoral Training Programme.</a> 
                My research interests primarily focus on wetlands ecology and conservation, and as part of my DPhil, I will explore stressors causing wetland loss in the US and UK and how net environmental outcome policies (No Net Loss, Biodiversity Net Gain, Nutrient Neutrality, etc) can improve wetland restoration and conservation outcomes. 
                I hope to combine field data collection of biological and chemical wetland characteristics at UK sites with data synthesis approaches for thousands of wetland restoration projects in the US to link development stressors, restoration outcomes, and characteristics of project policies that led to successful wetland outcomes. 
                Prior to Oxford, I completed a B.S. in Biology from UC Berkeley, a MSc in Ecology from Imperial College London, and also spent two and a half years as a researcher at the United States Environmental Protection Agency, working on projects spanning ecotoxicology to blue carbon to wetland restoration.</p>
